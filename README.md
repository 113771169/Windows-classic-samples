# Windows classic samples

This repo contains samples that demonstrate the API used in Windows classic desktop applications.

These samples demonstrate the functionality and programming model for Windows and Windows Server. This repo contains Visual Studio solution (SLN) filse for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). 

These samples were created for Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but some were created with earlier versions, or with specific SKU and other requirements. In many cases, the samples will also work on later versions than the ones indicated. If you cannot get a sample to work as expected, it might have platform, version, or SKU-specific requirements. If you have any issues with the samples, please provide feedback using the Issues list.
